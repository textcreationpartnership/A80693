         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170672:10"/> daily the bleſt <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> which are made in the ſaid Wardrobe. The Popes were wont to make the <hi>Agnus Dei's</hi> every ſeven yeares, but Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth in the yeare 1600. made them many times, as alſo great ſtore of Shrines, which hee cauſed to be diſtributed freely.</p>
                     <p>The entertainement of a ſecret Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine amounts to a thouſand crownes a yeare, and he that is a participant-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine hath eight or nine hundred crownes more then thoſe that are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipants, becauſe they participate of the rewards and donatives, which are given to the Popes Chamber, and of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the Apoſtolicall Chancerie.</p>
                     <p>The ſame entertainement, or little leſs then theſe Chamberlaines, have the ſecret-Chamberlaines, who helpe the Pope to officiate and ſerve him at Maſſe, when he ſayes it private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: One of them carries the Croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Holineſs; and when he goes on foot, another bears up the traine of the gowne. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth alwaies kept ſixe ſecret chaplaines, amongſt whom was a German, a Spaniard, a Frenchman, a Polander, and a Iapponeſe, who was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred after the manner of his country, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170672:10"/> in purple colour, all of them nobly borne. His Holineſſe hath for the Maſter of his Chamber the Lord <hi>Silvio Antoniani Romano,</hi> who exerciſes alſo the charge of Secretary of the ſecret <hi>Brieves</hi> much to his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, who for the goodneſſe of his life, and eminency of learning was created a Cardinall. Moreover his Holineſs keepeth a ſecret Clerk of the private Chappell who hath a good entertainement, &amp; ſome perquiſites; and when the Pope goes to the Chappell pontifically, it belongs to the ſaid Chaplaines to carry the triple Crowne and the pretious Miters, going before the Croſſe in the ſame red habit, which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Chamberlaines weare.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo the Chaplaines of the Guards and Palfreymen, to the end they may hear Maſſe every morning, who are called common Chaplaines.</p>
                     <p>There are ſecret Adjutants of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who have halfe the entertainement of the Chamberlaines aforeſaid; and they alſo doe participate of ſome fees and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, which doe not appertaine to the ſecret Chamberlaines.</p>
                     <p>There are beſides them Chamberlaines of honour, all perſons of quality, and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious both for birth, and learning. Then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170672:11"/> are there the Chamberlaines <hi>della Buſſola;</hi> the chamberlaines <hi>extra muros;</hi> and the chamberlaines <hi>Scudiere;</hi> every one of the which keepes the watch, and hath his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice diſtinct, ſaving the chamberlaines of honour, who doe not appeare in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, but when they will; and by them the Popes uſe to ſend the Hatts to the new Cardinalls.</p>
                     <p>There is a Sewer, and a Carver of the Sacred Colledge, who hath both of them good entertainment and proviſion.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a Sewer and Carver of ſtrangers, and a Sewer for the poore, who waits every morning on thoſe poore, which eate in the Palace at his Holineſſe charge; an inſtitution introduced by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, who ordained, that the Father Rector of the Penitentiaries of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of the Societie of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould take care to bring in every morning twelve Pilgrims to eate in the Palace, as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. All the above mentioned Officers have good entertainement, and proviſion, and are attyred in purple, according to their quality, in a long habit downe to the ground. Likewiſe there are two Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for the Family, with good entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a purple habit, beſides the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170672:11"/> Chamberlain's Phyſitian.</p>
                     <p>His Holineſſe keepes a Gentleman of quality with the title of Maſter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (for the Popes do not uſe to give the title of Maſter of the Horſe) who hath good entertainment, proviſion, &amp; enjoyes many perquiſites. This ſame alone, beſides the Chamberlaines of honor of the Popes Court, goes with a cloak and ſword, and hath under him many perſons with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt proviſions, whom he may place and diſplace at his pleaſure; and in the ſtable he hath two hundred Horſes, with many Mules for Litters, and carriages. <hi>Clement</hi> the eight introduced the conferring of the title of ſecret Chamberlain on Cavaliers of the Cloak and Sword; and thoſe ſame held that title onely for honors ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imploying themſelves in any thing of ſervice. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the eleventh alſo gave this title of Maſter of the Horſe to Signior <hi>Pompeo Frangipani,</hi> a principall Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, and a ſouldier of great merit.</p>
                     <p>There are other under-Officers, which have the cuſtody of the Popes furniture, &amp; Houſhold-ſtuffe; and theſe are to take care to ſee the rooms accommodated, when there is a Conſiſtorie, a Signature of Grace, and a Congregation.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170672:12"/>
                     <p>Then there are ſecret and publique ſweepers, who are apparelled in Purple, with an under-coat to the calf of the legg, and were formerly the Popes Coachmen, when he was a Cardinal; as alſo Palfrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are alwaies above forty; for you muſt know, that every new Pope u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to take for his Palfrey men, all the Deans of the Cardinals, and Ambaſſadors Palfreymen, that are in <hi>Rome</hi> at the time of his Aſſumption: which cuſtome is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably obſerved, and they are attired in red, or white cloth, as they will them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves, but at the Popes charge, with a purple cloake, and guilt ſword. There are likewiſe twelve Macebearers, and twelve Vergers, both of them vendible Offices, and each one is worth ſix hundred crownes, or thereabouts, yielding them fifty crowns a year a piece.</p>
                     <p>There are moreover a great number of lower Offices, which ſhall be noted in the end of the preſent Relation.</p>
                     <p>You are to underſtand, that the Gate of the Palace ſtands alwaies but half open, and through it in that manner doth every Cardinal, Ambaſſador, and other perſon paſſe, that go to negotiate with his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but both the leaves of the Gate are

                     <p>NOw wee will ſpeake of the Offices which are in the perſons of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, beginning with the Popes Vicar, which Office is moſt antient, having beene a long time out of the ſacred Colledge of of the Cardinalls, and exerciſed by ſuch as were but ſimply Biſhops; but <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth brought that dignity to the ſaid Colledge, having declared Cardinal <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Savelli</hi> for his Vicar; whoſe juriſdiction is over the Prieſts, and Regulars inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo over the companies of Laymen, Hoſpitalls, pious places, Jews, and Curtezans, within the precincts thereof. The Cardinall-Vicar hath for his entertainment an hundred crownes a month, paid him by the reverend Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. This Office hath four Notaries, every one of the which exerciſeth his Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, with eight or nine Clerks under him; It hath likewiſe two Lieutenants, the one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170672:19"/> for civill, who is commonly a Referenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prelate, and the other for criminal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and alſo a Vicegerent, a Prelate too; but for ſome years paſt, he ſtill hath been a Titular Biſhop, to the end he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all Epiſcopall functions in <hi>Rome:</hi> and he hath the ſuperintendance, or particular care of the Monaſteries of Nunnes; he is preſent likewiſe with the other Officers in the Congregations, which are made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt eminent Cardinal-Vicar, for matters, and cauſes of that Tribunall; and hath under him a Provoſt Marſhall, with good ſtore of ſergeants.</p>

                     <p>IN the time of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the Pope, two hundred yeares after <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, many Chriſtians having ſacrificed to Idolls, there was great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, wehther the relapſers ſhould be admitted to reconciliation, whereupon ſprung the ſchiſm made by <hi>Novatianus;</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Major part prevailed, that they ſhould be accepted: But becauſe ſome had ſinned leſſe, then others, there were Prieſts deputed, which <hi>pro modo culpae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſam
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170672:19"/> poenitentiam indulgent:</hi> From whence grew the uſe of Penitentiaries, and all that intervenes in thoſe caſes: Whereupon it was conſtituted, that in each of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchall Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> there ſhould be two Prieſts, who ſhould have the care of impoſing pennance according to the penitentiall Canons, which are moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as the Bibliothecarie makes mention; and this is all that is found written of it. Now it is likely, that thoſe Prieſts conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the ſaid Churches, had a head, with whom they were to confer, which upon occaſion communicated important caſes to the Pope; and this was the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary, who in truth ought to be very antient: but the moſt antient mention that <hi>P. Panvino</hi> hath of it, is in that of <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth in <hi>capit. ubi periculum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The charge of the chiefe Penitentiarie is exerciſed at this day by a moſt eminent Cardinal, conferred on him by his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and yields him about eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crowns a year. He hath under him a Prelate with the title of the Regent of the Penitentiaria; whoſe juriſdiction is over the caſes referred to his Holineſſe, granting abſolutions <hi>gratis ubique,</hi> directed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved confeſſors in Parliament, ſealed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170672:20"/> with the uſuall ſeale of the Penitentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinal Penitentiarie ſits with much ſolemnity, ſometimes in one, and ſometimes in another of the three Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Churches, that is of Saint <hi>John de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi> of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> upon a ſeat three or four degrees high, in form of a Tribunall, with a ſtaffe of Office in his hand, to heare the confeſſions of caſes reſerved: he makes his Congregation alſo with the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his regent, of the Prelate that keeps the Seale, and two or three Divines, which which are ordinarily Jeſuits, as all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome one Canoniſt.

                     <p>THE Chancellors wrote all that which antiently occurred to the Pope to write, both when he gave anſwer to doubts of faith, which were demanded of him by the Provinces, and Biſhops; as all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170672:20"/> concerning any other thing: And the chiefeſt perſon of the Popes ſpirituall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion had that authority, which at this day the Secretaries of the <hi>Brieves,</hi> and the Secretaries <hi>ab intimis</hi> have; and moreover the ſame, which in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and in many other States, the Chancellor hath <hi>Lucas de Penna,</hi> reciting a certain Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Iſidores,</hi> ſets downe what the authority of this Office is. Hee had under him twelve, which were called <hi>Schrinerari,</hi> and one <hi>Protoſchrinerario;</hi> all which aſſiſted him in ſuſtaining the weight of his charge, according as he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them.</p>
                     <p>The moſt antient mention, which is found of this Office is in Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> in an Epiſtle of Monarchy <hi>ad Gerontiam,</hi> who was Chancellor.</p>
                     <p>This Office untill <hi>Gregory</hi> the eight was alwaies given to Biſhops, or Cardinalls; and about the year 1100. the Biſhop-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Saint <hi>Rufina</hi> was ever Chancellor, for ſo had <hi>Benedict</hi> the eight granted it by diſpenſation. It fell from that cuſtome in the year 1071. under <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, after whoſe time it was alwaies in the hands of Prieſts, or Deacon-Cardinals. <hi>Gregory</hi> the eight, who had this Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170672:21"/> made Pope, began to give it out of the Colledge of Cardinalls, and conferred it on a <hi>Lateranenſe</hi> Canon, who, becauſe he was no Cardinal, intitled himſelf <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellarij vicem Agens.</hi> The giving that Office out of the ſacred Colledge continued an hundred years; and the Miniſters <hi>vicem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes,</hi> were called Vicechancellors, as a more commodious word.</p>
                     <p>This Office under <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the ſacred Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, and was given to <hi>Ricardo Pelroni,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Siena,</hi> who being made a Cardinal, never remembring the antient inſtitution, continued Vice-chancellor, and ſo thorough heedleſneſſe it came to be the name of the Office.</p>
                     <p>He that had this Office was called Chancellor or Bibliothecarie, which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much in effect, becauſe he was likewiſe Praefect of the Library.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170672:50"/> to the Chamber of Ornaments, to put on his ſacred veſtures, two of them are there ready, to help the Deacons Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, in attyring him with them, which being done, one of them takes up, and carries the Croſſe before him: Between the Croſſe and the Pope, none are to go, but only the Cardinalls, and ſuch as do ſit on their ſeat. The Maſter doore-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do alwaies aſſociate the Croſſe, the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other, with their ſilver verges. When the Pope either after the Sermon, or at the end of Maſſe, is to give his ſolemn Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diiction, the Sub-deacon takes up the Croſſe, and placeth himſelfe juſt before the Pope, turning the Crucifix towards him; for it is to be noted, that whenſoever the Croſſe is carried before the Pope, the Sub deacon ever turnes the Crucifix back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon him, and when he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he turnes the Crucifix forward. Of the ſeverall ſervices which the Sub-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons performe in divers acts unto the Pope, and their adminiſtration about the Pall, is ſufficiently ſpoken of in other places; theſe are all the offices of the Court, that are of moſt eminency.</p>

                     <p>AFter that the Fame of the excellencie of life, and Holineſſe of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon, together with the miracles he hath done, have been ſpread abroad, and that the Pope hath been made acquainted therewith, by ſome King, Prince or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which doe pray, that the ſaid perſon being dead, may be inrolled in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Saints, and be declared and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for a Saint; his Holineſſe doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of the matter with his Brethren, whereupon if he thinks it fit to proceed to inquiſition, he requires ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, which are reſident in thoſe parts, where the ſaid perſon lived, and lies bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, diligently to informe themſelves, and carefully to enquire of the fame, opinion and peoples devotion, concerning the ſaid perſon: which inquiſition they are to make without the Legall examination of witneſſes; and what they finde, faithfully to report by their Letters unto the Pope, who doth then propound all that hath been related by the ſaid Prelates unto the ſacred Colledge, and with them, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170672:54"/> proofes, and depoſitions of the witneſſes, and carefully to conſider all things, that are to be conſidered, eſpecially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid perſons excellency of life, and puritie of faith, which if they ſhall be judged by the Colledge to be well proved, and worthy of ſanctification, the Pope with the conſent of the Cardinalls, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the approbation of the ſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons life, and miracles, which have been ſo ſufficiently proved, and decrees the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization of him: After this, all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Court, with the Pope and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Colledge, aſſemble together in the ſecret Conſiſtory; where his Holineſſe briefly propounds to what end they are there met, and declares with what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and faithfulneſſe the inquiſition of this matter hath been made, how full and legall the atteſtation thereof hath been, and with what inſtance, Princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſued unto him about it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he requires them, that in diſcharge of theri conſciences, they would each of them in particular deliver their opinion freely and ſincerely; and when they have done ſo, he gives them thanks for their good counſel, exhorting them to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that he will not ſuffer them to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170672:55"/> erre in ſo weighty a buſineſſe, and ſo they all goe away. The day of Canonization being determined, there is in the meane time a wooden Scaffold erected in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, of that bigneſſe, as upon it may be fitted a Chappell, with an Altar, a Pontificall Throne, ſeats for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls aſſiſting the Pope, for Ambaſſadors, for a quire of ſinging men, and places for all the orders of the Roman Court, like unto the Chappell of the Apoſtolicall Palace, with Lattice windows, and of that capacitie, and with ſuch manner of ſeats: there is alſo a faire paire of Stairs made to aſcend unto that Scaffold, which on the outſide is ſtrewed all over with herbs and flowers, and on the inſide is hung with goodly peeces of Tapeſtry: the Church too is very richly adorned, and the Armes of the Pope, and of the Church, as alſo the image of him that is to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized hanged round about it. The day of Canonization being come, the Pope in all his Pontificalibus, and with his triple Crowne on his head, goes under a Canopy of State, borne over him in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, with all the Cardinalls, Prelats, and Officers, each of them with a new wax light burning in his hand, unto the

After that, he repaires unto the Altar, and places himſelfe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſeate, made ready for him; where he makes a ſpeech, relating ſummarily, and in generall termes, all that hath beene done in the buſineſſe, as alſo the life, and miracles of the perſon aforeſaid; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all, to joyne with him in prayer unto God, that he would not permitt his Church to erre in this affaire. That done, the Proctor of the cauſe humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pope, in the name of the Princes, or people, which are ſuitors to him for it, that he will pronounce and declare <hi>N.</hi> to be a Saint; and that hee will cauſe him to be inrolled in the catalogue of Saints, and as a Saint to be honored of all faithfull Chriſtians. Whereupon the Pope with a loud voyce ſaith thus: To the honour of the inviſible Trinity, for exaltation of the Catholique faith, and augmentation of the Chriſtian Religion, We by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſaid God Almighty, the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, and the bleſſed Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> doe by the advice
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170672:56"/> of our Brethren Decree and declare <hi>N.</hi> of bleſſed memory to be a Saint; and to bee inrolled in the Catalogue of Saints: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, that his feaſt ſhall by the Church Univerſall be on ſuch a day every yeare devoutly, and ſolemnly celebrated. And do moreover by the ſame Authority grant unto all, that, being truly penitent, and confeſt, ſhall with devotion viſit the ſhrine of the ſaid Saint <hi>N.</hi> pardon of their ſinnes for an hundred and forty dayes. Now ſome Popes doe grant plenary Indulgence to ſuch viſitants, as we reade <hi>Boniface</hi> the ninth did, when he Canonized <hi>Brigid</hi> for a Saint: The Pope having finiſhed in the manner aforeſaid, <hi>Te Deum laudamus</hi> is ſung by the Gentlemen of the Chappell, at the end whereof the Deacon ſaith, <hi>Pray for us bleſſed Saint N.</hi> whereunto the Pope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>He are us, O Lord, for the prayers, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſake of holy Saint</hi> N. After this his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſings the Maſſe of the day, with the commemoration of the ſaid Saint; and whilſt the Creede is ſung, three Cardinalls offer unto the ſaid Saint in the Offertory three white waxe lights, three turtle doves alſo white, and other birds.

That done, he kiſſeth the Text which is held forth unto him by the Apoſtolicall Subdeacon; and ſo being Cenſed by the ſaid Cardinall Deacon, the Anthem of <hi>Mandatum novum,</hi> beginning to be ſung by the Singing men, he layes by his pluniate, and an aprone before him, in which habit he waſheth the feet of twelve poore men, unto each of whom he cauſeth to be given by the Treaſurer Generall ſucceſſively cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Medalls of gold and ſiluer; and by the Maſter of the Houſhold the Towell, wherewith their feet were wiped.

                     <p>THis word Cardinall, ſignifies no other, then <hi>Presbyter principalis; nam altiſſimae Caeli portae vocantur cardines, ventique inde ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes appellantur cardinales.

                     </p>
                     <p>This word, as it is likely, was found out in the time of Pope <hi>Higinius,</hi> an hundred and fifty yeares after Chriſt, whereas many Prieſts were placed in Pariſhes, and degrees of them ſetled, whereupon the Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170672:57"/> found, it was probable the name was then alſo found.</p>
                     <p>The firſt mention of the word Cardinall was in the time of Saint <hi>Silveſter,</hi> three hundred yeres after Jeſus Chriſt our Lord appeared by the Synod held in Rome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Saint <hi>Silveſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This word Cardinal is at this day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to three degrees; to Prieſts, Deacons, and Biſhops. At the firſt, as we ſee before, it was given to Prieſts only, whoſe Office it was then in particular, to have a care of the buriall of the Faithfull, whereunto the other Prieſts were not admitted, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the <hi>Bibliothecarie</hi> in the life of Pope <hi>Marcellus.</hi> As for the reſt, the Prieſts were equall, in preaching, in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments (except Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme as I have already ſaid) in aſſiſting the Pope, in being imployed as Legates; and this before <hi>Constantine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After <hi>Constantine,</hi> the Prieſt Cardinalls began to have I know not what kind of more prerogative above other Prieſts that were not Cardinals; ſo that leaving off that particular care of Baptiſme, and Burialls, they onely went forth in Legations, and of them above for the moſt part was the Pope made, having power over the Prieſts, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170672:58"/> Clerks of their juriſdiction.</p>
                     <p>This continued ſixe hundred yeares, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh; at which time, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by the Emperor, as of the reſt of the Clergy, and people from the election, the authority of the Cardinalls increaſed, for that they were they alone, which made the Pope, and commonly out of their own order. Now that they might maintaine their dignity, the revenew of their Titles not being ſufficient for many of them, they began to have <hi>in commenda</hi> ſimple Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Canonſhips, Archpresbyters, and the like.</p>
                     <p>When a Biſhoprick was given to any of theſe, the dignity of Cardinall was void, as inferior to the other.

                     <p>In proceſſe of time, the Biſhops begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to deſire to be Cardinalls, ſought for meanes to make Cardinalls that were no Prieſts, but they were not able to doe it untill <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight was Pope, when as the Court went to <hi>Avignion,</hi> where every thing going to confuſion, both Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons were made Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls; and Cardinals had Biſhopricks, and Abbacies more then one, given them <hi>in commenda:</hi> upon this occaſion too the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls began to proceed Biſhops, that were meere Biſhops; and this precedencie began not abſolutely, but in <hi>Avignion.</hi>

                     <p>THe Titles of Prieſts-Cardinalls, were of a determinate number, that is, eight and twenty, as thoſe of the Deacons eighteen, and thoſe of the Biſhops ſeven. Now in Rome there were five Churches built, which were called Patriarchall; that is, Saint <hi>John de Lateran,</hi> repreſenting the Pope: Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> repreſenting the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that of <hi>Alexandria, Sancta Maria magiore,</hi> that of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> and Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> without the Walls, that of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Miniſters of the <hi>Lateran</hi> (for that it was the Cathedrall) were deputed the ſeven Biſhops Cardinalls, to that of the others (becauſe they were of leſſe dignity) ſeven Prieſts Cardinalls for each of them; and this number was ſetled for twelve hundred years, untill the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond; before whom, Cardinalls were not made many together, but one by one as they came to be void.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſecond, finding divers Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinallſhips void, began firſt to make many Cardinalls together, which was continued untill about four hundred years ſince; at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170672:61"/> which time the number of Cardinalls ſeeming to be too great, they began when Cardinalls dyed, not to put others in their roomes, but to give them in <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> to other Cardinals or leave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them to the Cardinalls Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts; ſo that in proceſſe of time it came to that paſſe, as no longer minding the antient number of fifty three, they grew to be exceedingly diminiſhed: howbeit, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, not only reſtored them to the ſaid number again, but it was by him, and Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth exceeded, inſomuch that the eight and twenty titles of the Prieſts Cardinalls not ſufficing, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> made thirteen, Pope <hi>Iulian</hi> the third, three, and Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth one more: Now it is to be noted, that before Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> they never exceeded the number of fifty and three.</p>
                     <p>It was an antient cuſtome obſerved in the Church, for fourteen hundred yeers together, that no oppoſition was amongſt the Cardinalls; for a Deacon made not himſelfe a Prieſt, unleſſe he loſt his Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip, and then took upon him the title of Prieſt; and in like ſort, if a Prieſt became a Biſhop, he left the title of Prieſt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170672:62"/> but continuing a Prieſt he never changed his title, neither a Biſhop his Biſhoprick, nor a Deacon his Deaconſhip.</p>
                     <p>One of thoſe actions ſprang from the Schiſme of the Councell of <hi>Piſa,</hi> where the Cardinall yeelding to the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obedience, ſome Cardinals of <hi>Avigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> being of the ſame Cardinall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it was neceſſary that one of them ſhould relinquiſh his, and for this they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan afterwards to change, which hath been the ruine of the Churches, where there were Titles of Deaconſhips.</p>
                     <p>It was an ancient cuſtome likewiſe, which laſted five hundred yeares, even to the time of Pope <hi>Sixtus quartus,</hi> that a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſhould have no title, nor a Prieſt a Deaconſhip, it being a thing repugnant to give the cure of ſoules to a Deacon, and to a Prieſt a Deaconſhip.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Sixtus quartus</hi> was the firſt that confounded this Cardinalſhip, giving to Prieſts Deaconſhips, &amp; titles to Deacons; and the matter went ſo farre forward, that there is not a title, which hath not had a Deacon: wherein yet is to be noted, that the Deacon, although he hath a title, as the Cardinall <hi>Montallo</hi> had of <hi>San Lorenſo in Domaſo,</hi> yet hee uſeth not the name of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170672:62"/> title, as to ſay, <hi>Alexander Sancti Laurentii, &amp; Damaſo Diaconus Cardinalis,</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the title: and contrarily the Prieſt Cardinall, that hath a Deaconſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ought to ſpeake of the title, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no title, yet he adjoynes it, as <hi>Jacobus Sabellus</hi> of the title, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>THe Pope doth uſe to make Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls two ſeverall waies; the firſt is this: Thoſe perſons which are abiding in <hi>Rome,</hi> whom his Holineſſe purpoſeth to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170672:63"/> promote, have notice given them thereof over night by the Cardinall Nephewes, whereupon the next morning they repaire to the Palace at the uſuall houre.</p>
                     <p>The Pope, when as the ſecret Conſiſtory is ſhut up, pronunceth the Cardinalls, whom he intends to make; and in the ſame Conſiſtory cauſes them to bee called in, where kneeling downe at his Holines feet, the Pope puts the red hatt on his head, and making the ſigne of the Croſſe on it, hee ſayes to him, <hi>Eſto Cardinalis,</hi> and weare this red hatt, as a ſigne, that thou wilt without feare expoſe thy ſelf even to death, and the effuſion of thy deareſt bloud, for the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy faith, for the peace &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of Chriſtian people, and augmenting the ſtate of the holy Roman Church; in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then the new Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall takes off the Hatt from his head, and kiſſeth his Holineſſe feet.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond way is this. In the ſecret Conſiſtory the Pope pronounceth in order of dignitie the Cardinalls which he hath made, and then gives a liſt of them to the Cardinall Nephew, who ſends his Maſter of the Chamber with his owne Coach to fetch thoſe perſons which are promoted,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170672:64"/> from out of ſuch parts of the City as they live in, and bring them to his Eminencies Lodgings. There they have their Crowns ſhaven, and are attyred in purple like Cardinalls; the garments wherewith they were apparrelled before are the vailes of the Cardinall Nephewes adjutants of the Chamber; and the Cardinall Nephewes Barber that ſhaved their crownes receives from them five and twenty duckets for his fee. After dinner the ſame Cardinall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving feaſted the new Cardinalls, conducts them to his Holineſſe, before whoſe feet kneeling on their knees they have the red hatt put upon their heads in the manner before declared; and after many words of humility, and thanks, they depart away: and ſo goe all in the habit of a Cardinall together to viſit his Holineſſe kinsfolks, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well men as women continuing afterwards in their houſes untill the publique Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, alwaies cloathed in purple till the day of the ſaid Conſiſtory, though it bee <hi>extra tempora,</hi> and giving audience to every one that comes to viſit them.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170672:64"/> nor ought not to accompany them farther then the Chamber doore, where hee received the viſit: But the ancient good rule was, that the Cardinalls did not viſit the new.

                     <p>The Cardinall which goes to <hi>Rome</hi> to take the Hatt, is to goe in the travelling

                     <p>In the firſt ſecret Conſiſtory, after the publick Conſiſtory, the Pope performes the ceremony of ſhutting up the new Cardinalls mouth, his Holineſſe ſpeaking and praying, and the new Cardinall not ſaying a word. This ſhutting up of the mouth, deprives the new Cardinall of his active and paſſive voice.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond Conſiſtory, his Holineſſe opens his mouth, declares his title unto him, and eſpouſes him with a Gold Ring, that hath a Saphire ſet in it, for which in times paſt, the Cardinals heir (in caſe he dyed) paid five hundred duckats in the Chamber: Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth gave this fee of the Ring to the German Colledge of <hi>Rome,</hi> but afterwards Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> took it from thence, and by <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, it was aſſigned to the ſacred Colledge <hi>de propaganda fide,</hi> and it was by a Pontificall Bull ordained, that it ſhould be alwaies done by every Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170672:67"/> from the very day of his promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Any one that ſhall be made a Cardinall, and before his coming to <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a Legat; he may exerciſe his Legat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if his Holineſſe pleaſure be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, untill he hath firſt the Hat; and in that caſe the Pope uſeth to ſend it unto him with a <hi>Brieve:</hi> afterwards when that Legation is finiſhed, and that the ſame Cardinall comes to <hi>Rome,</hi> he is at any hand to have a publique Conſiſtory granted to him, together with the wonted ſolemn riding. Every Cardinall hath the Hatt, which his Holineſſe puts on his head, brought home to him to his houſe by a ſecret Chamberlain, in a ſilver and gilt Baſon, that is carried by the Popes cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord-keeper, unto whom is uſed to be given a reward of five and twenty crowns of Gold.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the new Cardinall is to give the rewards which are mentioned hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Every Cardinall paſſeth the Bull of his Cardinalſhip, which being ſubſcribed by the Pope, and all the Cardinals preſent in <hi>Rome,</hi> the uſuall ſeale of lead is put to it, and ſometimes one of Gold.</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170672:71"/> with reverence and modeſty, to deliver their opinions, not by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and impugning that of others, but reſpectfully obſerving every one to declare their minds with that judgment and wiſdome, which the Lord ſhould vouchſafe to indue them withall, to have God alwaies before their eyes in giving their counſells and votes, to govern their houſes and families with all moderation and honeſty, not ſuffering in them any gamſters, quarellers, riotous, or infamous perſons; for that commonly the vices of the Maſter, do appear in the lives of the ſervants, according to the ſaying, ſuch as the King is, ſuch are the people; to beſtow themſelves when they are free from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affaires, in the Study of good Letters; and alwaies to have ſome part of the holy Scriptures read at their Tables. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation ended, he opens their mouths, ſaying: We open your mouths to ſpeak in all Councells, in Electing of the high Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and in all acts, both within the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and without it, which appertains to Cardinalls, and which they are uſed to exerciſe, in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt, Amen.</p>

Now this is the order which is obſerved with a perſon that is deſtinated to a Church: he muſt go to his examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before his Holineſſe, where he muſt be all the while upon his knees, kneeling on a Cuſhion: If he doth not carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe well, he is rejected; if he doth carry

                     <p>The Proceſſe being compiled, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Ponents ſubſcribes it, and then ſends it to be reviewed by the three Cardinals, heads of their Order, who having review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, ſubſcribe it alſo, and ſo return it to the Cardinall Ponents, with whom it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies afterwards remains: In the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, then it is publiſhed, and in the next following, it is propounded, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering briefly in Latin that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Proceſſe. Now before the

                     <p>The day before the Conſiſtory of the propoſition, the Cardinall Ponents ſends a memoriall by one to all the Cardinalls, wherein is ſuccinctly ſet forth all that is expreſſed in the Proceſſe; to the end, that if any Cardinall will ſay ought againſt it, he may know what he hath to ſpeak of. When as the Cardinall Ponents have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the propoſition, the Pope turnes to the Deacon Cardinall, and asketh him whether he hath any thing to ſay in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of it; unto which, riſing up on his feet, his Eminency anſwers no; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Holineſſe decrees that Church to ſuch an one. Of all this, the Cardinall vice-Chancellor takes cognizance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gives forth the Decree made in the Conſiſtory; upon which decree, the Cardinall Ponents frames the Schedule
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170672:75"/> ſubſcribed with his hand, by vertue whereof, together with another like it, made by the Cardinall vice-chancellor, and called the contra-Schedule, the <hi>Bulls</hi> are diſpatched.</p>
                     <p>The perſon propounded, is not to goe out of his houſe that morning when his propoſition is to be made, but then is to have his Crowne ſhaven; after dinner he muſt attire himſelfe in the purple habit of a Biſhop, and ſo go to the Popes Palace, where by the Lord Maſter of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he is brought to kiſſe the feet of his Holineſſe, who with his owne hands, puts the Rochet, which Biſhops uſe to weare, upon him, and then he is to give the Pope thanks, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After this, the new Biſhop is to viſit all the ſacred Colledge, beginning at the Deacon-Cardinall, whom he muſt alwaies viſit firſt; for the reſt, he needeth not to obſerve any order, but to viſit them one after another as it ſhall fall out: The next he is to viſit, are the governors of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Auditor of the Chamber, the Treaſurer-Generall, and the <hi>Datarie,</hi> from whom he is to procure the Patent <hi>dell' Alternative,</hi> before he departs to his reſidence.</p>

                     <p>There are to be three Biſhops to the Conſecration; he that conſecrates, who for the moſt part is a Cardinall, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops likewiſe conſecrators: In the day of the conſecration the new Biſhop precedes the other more antient Biſhops, in regard it is the day of his nuptialls; and ordinarily, that Cardinall which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, invites the conſecrated Biſhop to dinner, as alſo the aſſiſtant Biſhops, the Maſter of the Ceremonies, and ſome others.</p>
                     <p>Every Arch-Biſhop, or Biſhop, ere he be conſecrated, muſt before the Prime Deacon Cardinall, ſweare upon the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts fealtie to the Apoſtolique Sea, and obedience to the Roman high Biſhop, and this is required to be done by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, in the preſence of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; during the performance whereof, the ſaid Cardinall ſits in his ſeat with his Hatt on, and the Prelate is bare-headed, kneeling on a cuſhion.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things before mentioned doth the Arch-Biſhop alſo, yea ſomething more; for a Conſiſtoriall Advocate demands the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170672:76"/> Pall for him in the ſecret Conſiſtory, and and then the ſaid Arch-Biſhop enters into the ſecret Conſiſtory for it: If the Arch-Biſhop be not preſent in <hi>Rome,</hi> he takes it <hi>per procuratorem.</hi>

                     <p>The Cardinall Ponents hath ordained <hi>de jure</hi> fifteene duckets of the Chamber for every hundred, whereat that Church which is propounded by him is taxed: but when as his Holineſſe propounds one, that fee goes to the Apoſtolicall Secretaries; &amp; when he propounds a Church in a perſon of a Cardinall, that was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> he muſt pay fifteene in the hundred, but if he be preſent in <hi>Rome,</hi> or hath been there at other times, he is exempted from ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170672:77"/> or Patriarchs, nor may they in the meane time conſecrate, celebrate a Synod, or exerciſe many other Pontificall functions, before they receive the Pall, taken from the body of bleſſed <hi>Peter;</hi> which they are to demand by themſelves, or their Proctor, within the ſpace of ſixe moneths. The care of making and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Palls appertaines to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Subdeacons, who make them of pure and white wooll in this manner. The Nunnes of Saint <hi>Annes</hi> Monaſtery do offer every yeare two white Lambes on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of that Church in the Feſtivall day of Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> is ſinging in ſolemne Maſſe. Now thoſe two lambes are delivered to the Canons of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teranens Churches, and are afterwards conſigned by them to the Apoſtolicall Subdeacons, who put them to feede in certaine paſtures, untill the time of ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them be come: then they ſheare off their wooll, and mixing it with other like pure and white wooll, they ſpin it into yarne, wherewith the Palls are woven three fingers broad into an orbicular form, ſo as it may compaſſe the Archbiſhops ſhoulders: The Pall hath a kind of labell hanging down before to the breſt, and two
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170672:77"/> more behind, on each ſhoulder one, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe to the reines, an hands breadth and an halfe long; upon the end whereof are thin leaden plates of the ſame breadth, round at the bottom, which are covered over with black taffeta, that is ſowed downe upon the ſaid pendant labells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and behind. The Palls being made after this ſort by the Subdeacons, they are carried to the Cathedrall Church of the Prince of the Apoſtles, and by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons thereof are laid upon the bodies of the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> under the high Altar, where being watched one night, according to the wonted cuſtome, they are taken from thence, and reſtored againe to the Subdeacons, who carefully keep them in a convenient and decent place. The uſe of the Pall, ſo far as we can finde, is very ancient, and had its originall from Pope <hi>Linus,</hi> the immediate Succeſſor of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> for ſo we reade writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Biſhop <hi>Maximus</hi> in an Homilie of the Sacerdotall veſture, who there ſaith, our Patriarkes doe hold that our Ephod (namely the Pall) was inſtituted by <hi>Linus,</hi> the ſecond Roman Biſhop after <hi>Peter,</hi> and given by God to our Prelates for a ſingular and ſpeciall priviledge of power. And
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170672:78"/> 
                        <hi>Euſebius Caeſarienſis</hi> in a ſermon of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany</hi> writeth thus; Nothing is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then that Sacerdotall veſture of our Prelates, which ſucceeded to that made of the ſilke and gold in the old Teſtament, wherewith <hi>Linus</hi> firſt of all was adorned, in ſigne of plenary power, and whereunto as we have received from ancient writers, he gave the types, and name, calling it a Pall. When as any Prelate wants the Pall, it is firſt demanded by ſome one of the Conſiſtoriall Advocates, whom to that end he hath eſpecially conſtituted for his Proctor, of the Pope in the ſecret Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie with much inſtance. The Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commanded the Advocate forth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the opinion of the Fathers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pall ſhall be given accordingly, or no: Then he committs to the chiefe Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con-Cardinall the conſigning of the Pall to the ſaid Prelate, or his Proctor; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſaid Cardinall appoints the place and day, where, and when the Pall ſhall be conſigned, which for the moſt part is in the Chappell of the ſaid Cardinalls houſe, but ſometimes in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church at the high Altar. The day being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Prelate comes to the place ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, where are preſent the Deacon Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170672:78"/> and the Apoſtolicall Subdeacon with the Pall, which he ſpreads over the midſt of the Altar. Then the Prelate kneeling on the ſtepps of the Altar before the ſaid Deacon Cardinall, prayeth the Pall may be given unto him in theſe words: <hi>I.

                     <p>They who are to receive the Pall, after it is demanded, and granted to him in the Conſiſtory, do uſually compound with the ſub-Deacons, who, as we have ſaid, do keep the Palls, and do receive from the Prelats, ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe in the hundred, according to the valew and taxation of the Church: The Maſters of the Ceremonies too, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Office, and the drawing up of the inſtrument, have certain fees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of the valew, and taxation of the Churches, but not ſo much as the ſub-Deacons.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170672:79"/> Pontificall Halls, which are contained in the Conclave, the greateſt of them is uſed to be furniſhed, and made ready for the publick Conſiſtory, when as either Kings or their Ambaſſadors are to be received, and the Canonization of a Saint is to be celebrated. In the other hall, are the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Princes, &amp; common-wealths, when they come to yield obedience to the Pope, received; as alſo the Apoſtolicall Legats, returning from their Legations, and new Cardinalls coming to the Roman Court: In it too are the new Cardinals publiſhed, and all cauſes handled which require a publick Conſiſtory. At the upper end of the Hall, is a Pontificall Throne erected, with an aſcent of three ample ſteps unto it, the forme of the Throne is almoſt foure-ſquare, and about twelve hand-breadths broad, in the midſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a ſeat joyning to the Wall, with a great and little foot-ſtoole; all the floor of the Throne is covered with Scarlet cloth, and ſo is the great footſtool, but the Wall is adorned with cloth of Gold, and likwiſe the ſeat, over which hangs a cloth of State of the ſame ſtuffe; on the right hand within the Throne are the ſeats of the Biſhops, and Prieſts Cardinalls, two
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170672:80"/> hands breadth from the Wall, having a back to lean againſt as high as their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and a ſtep ſeven or eight fingers high to ſet their feet upon, unto which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning another ſeat, that ſtands athwart the Hall, ſo that they who ſit upon it do look the Pope in the face: On his holineſſe left hand is the ſeat of the Deacons-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, betwixt the which and the ſeat that goes croſſe the Hall, is a void ſpace, about an eleven or twelve hands-breadth, which ſerves as a door into the entrance of the Conſiſtory. Theſe ſeats are adorned with Arras and Tapeſtry, and are of one and the ſame length and breadth; all the room about the ſeats is overſpread with green cloth.</p>

The Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Pronotaries and all the Prelates, ſit upon the three Steps of the Pontificall Throne, and with them laſt of all the Sub-deacons, Auditors, and Clerks of the Chamber:

                     <p>THe ſecret Conſiſtory is held in ſome remoter roome of the Apoſtolicall Palace, at this day called the Papall Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; where in the midſt of it is a Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeate erected againſt the wall, which is raiſed from the ground without ſteps or degrees; and hath a great footſtoole, on which the the Pope ſetts his feet, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther litle one, whereby one may aſcend higher. The Cardinals ſeats are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope, on the right, &amp; left hand, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryone in its order. The Popes ſeate is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with cloth of gold; the Cardinalls ſeates are bare, but painted red with his Holineſſe Armes upon them. The place between the Popes ſeate and the Cardinals is uſually covered with tapeſtry. The ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Deacon Cardinall hath a little bell by him, wherewith hee gives notice to the Keepers of the Conſiſtory, if the Pope or Fathers will have them to doe any thing. In the ſpace between the Cardinalls ſeates are two formes placed round at a pretty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the one from the other, untill all are come in, ſo that the Cardinals may betwixt

When as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoriall matters begin to be treated of; all other Prelates, beſides the Cardinalls are ſhut out. Two ſecret Chamberlaines waite without at the doore of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that they may bee ready upon the ringing the bell, for any command. The Pope propounds ſuch buſineſſes as are to be handled in the Senate, and in order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires their opinions, which are called votes, then each of them riſing up gives his vote; whereupon his Holineſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the major part, decrees.</p>

                     <head>Of the Conclave.</head>
                     <p>THe place of the Conclave (for ſo is that called at this day wherein the Fathers are ſhutt up for election of the Pope) is in the Apoſtolicall Palace; and it containes two Halls, and Chappells, with ſome other roomes, and houſes of Office: all which are ſo cloſed up with a wall that one can ſee no windowes, but what are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, thoſe only excepted by which you
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170672:82"/> paſſe unto the Chappells, and ſecond Hall. The Halls are for the Cardinalls to walke in, and recreate themſelves in, when they are not imployed in the Election; the other roomes are for the uſe of ſuch, as are alſo ſhutt up with the Cardinalls in the Conclave. The gate at the entrance into the firſt Hall hath a wicket in it, through which the Cardinalls dyet is brought in unto them; and the ſaid gate and wicket are made ſafe with ſtrong iron barrs, and foure locks. In the leſſer Chappell the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meete to celebrate Divine Service, and to make the election. In the greater Chappell are ſo many Cells made, as there be Cardinalls voting in election; which are diſtant about a foot one from another, and are not ſeparated aſunder by any wall, or ſuch like matter, but by curtaines or thin cloth, which hang upon rafters ſet up all along in a decent manner for that purpoſe. Now theſe Cells all are marked with the letters of the Alphabet, and on the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cardinals enter into the conclave, and are ſeverally aſſigned to each of them; not by order, but by lott: and then doe their ſervants in that interim make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of curtaines, beds, and other furniture for them. The Conclave being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170672:83"/> eſpeciall order is taken that none may goe, ſtand, or abide above, below, or on any of the ſides of the Conclave, nor that any may ſee, ſpeak, or any way ſend, or caſt any thing unto them that are ſhut up in it, leſt thereby any might be enabled to ſearch into their Counſells by voice, ſigne, ſound, or any other device. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there are foure guards of the further Conclave appointed: the guard of the firſt gate of the Palace is committed to ſome great Prelate, or Nobleman, who with two or three hundred ſouldiers, is to guard the Palace and the Fathers night and day. The ſecond guard is within the firſt gate, as one goes up unto the Conclave, and is under the charge of the Conſervators, and <hi>Caporioni</hi> of the Citty of <hi>Rome.</hi> The third guard is a little higher at the ſecond gate, and is intruſted to a ſelect number of noble perſonages. The fourth and laſt guard is at the immediat entrance into the Conclave, and is in the hands of ſeven or eight of the worthieſt Biſhops of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Court. The guard of the firſt gate of the Palace is ſetled aſſoon as the Pope is dead, but ſo are not the others untill the Cardinalls enter into the Conclave. The gate and wicket at the entrance into the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170672:83"/> firſt Hall is, as I have ſaid before, made faſt with four locks, one to the outſide of the gate, and one on the outſide of the wicket; alſo one on the inſide of the gate, and one on the inſide of the wicket: the two keys of the locks on the outſide of the gate and wicket are kept by the guard of that place, the other two keys of the locks on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the gate and wicket, are in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of the Maſters of the Ceremonies, ſo that neither the Gate nor the wicket can be opened without the conſent both of them that are within and without.</p>

This done, he went in proceſſion to the lodge of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and there having given a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Benediction; the Prince Cardinall of <hi>Medici</hi> publiſhed a plenary indulgence in Latin, and the like did Cardinall <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Barberino</hi> in the Italian tongue: Then did his Holineſſe againe, give another Benediction to the people, whereof there was an infinite company there preſent, crying out with a loud voice, long live, long live Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the tenth; vvhich acclamations of theirs was accompanied with the ſound of Trumpets, Drums, and Bells, and the ſhot of great Ordnance, and other ſmaller peeces, this Ceremony fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the Pope returned to Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> being accompanied with all the Cardinals, and a great number of Princes, and Lords.</p>

                     <head>Of the ſickneſſe, death, and obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of the Pope.</head>
                     <p>ALbeit the Roman high Biſhop doth excell all mortall men in dignity and authority, and is able to bind and looſe all things on earth, yet cannot he avoid the extreame neceſſity of Fate; for the diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant greater then his Lord God did not ſpare his only begotten ſonne, but would have him dye, that he might deliver man from Eternall Death, to the end all may know, that none is exempted from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death: The Pope is to think, that though he be the higheſt of all, yet he is mortall, and ought carefully to beare in mind that Ceremony of the blaze which is uſed amongſt other ſolemnities of his Coronation: Holy Father, thus paſſeth away the glory of the world; all fleſh is graſſe, and the beauty thereof as the flower of the field. Wherefore he ſhould accordingly be alwaies prepared, as a good Paſtor and a diligent Steward, to render an account of his ſtewardſhip unto his Lord, deſiring to be diſſolved, and to be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170672:103"/> with Chriſt, and carefully endeavour to performe with praiſe that laſt act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the elect are wont to be Crowned. Now if the Pope doth not know whilſt he is ſick the danger of his diſeaſe, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians that are about him, aſſoon as they are in doubt of him, do exhort him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly with prudent words to doe all that is behoofefull for the good of his ſoule, promiſing in the mean time not to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in any thing that may conduce to the recovering of his health; after which they acquaint the Popes Confeſſor with the ſtate of hs body, who more plainly, yet ſecretly, and with much reverence and charitie, declares unto his Holineſſe the perill he is in, admoniſhing him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe unto the pleaſure of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and conſidering what place he doth hold to direct other Princes by his words and example in the way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Pope of his owne accord, which is beſt, or incited by the ſaid admonitions, taking notice of the approach of his laſt day, firſt of all devoutly confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of all his ſinnes to his ghoſtly Father, and deſires a full abſolution of them from him; then in a convenient time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all his domeſticall Prelates, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170672:103"/> the chiefe of his family to be convented before him, in whoſe preſence, and of that of the Holy Sacrament of Chriſts body, he makes an open confeſſion of his faith, which he affirmeth he hath ever conſtantly held, and therein will by Gods grace live and dye. Afterwards he prayeth them all to forgive him, if by chance he hath unjuſtly offended any one, beſtows ſome ſpirituall graces on them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to pray for his ſoule, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the Veſtry-keeper, or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelates, that he may receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Viaticum;</hi> and that when it ſhall ſeem ſeaſonable unto them, they will admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the other ſacraments of the Church unto him. This done, whilſt he is in good and perfect memory, he ſends for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Senate of the Cardinals, before whom he againe makes confeſſion of his faith, craves pardon if in his government he hath offended any of them, intreats them to pray for his ſoule, commends the Church of God to them, exhorts them to be diligent, and unanimous in the election of his ſucceſſor, and to chuſe ſuch an one, as might feed the flock of Chriſt more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, then he could doe, naming, if he thinks good, one, or more, whom in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170672:104"/> his judgment he holds to be moſt fit: He alſo opens unto them his debts, and what is owing to him; manifeſts likwiſe unto them his writings, monies, and Jewels, makes his Will, and appoints the place of his buriall: Furthermore he recommends unto them his family, and retainers, and conferring on them ſuch ſpirituall graces, as they deſire of him, he diſmiſſeth them with his bleſſing. Hereupon the Cardinals perceiving the Pope to be drawing to his end, elect three of the Colledge, namely, one of every order, who together with the Chamberlain, take an inventory of all the goods that are in the Apoſtolicall Palace, and put them up in a ſafe place under good cuſtody: they look over all that is in the Lord Veſtry-keepers charge, continuing it ſtill in his hands, becauſe he is a perpetuall Officer: The Colledge of Cardinals do alſo take care that no tumult may ariſe in the Citty, if the Pope doth die there, prudently, and in time intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Eccleſiaſticall Militia, which they diſpoſe of in the moſt opportune pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the citty: They likewiſe provide for the provinces of the Church, ſending grave and wiſe men Commiſſaries unto them. The Pope being as it were at the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170672:104"/> laſt gaſpe, ſome of his domeſticall Prelats, ſtill offer him the Croſſe to look upon and kiſſe, putting him in minde of Chriſts paſſion: The Veſtry-keeper alſo Miniſters the ſacred unction unto him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his ſoule to God after the uſuall manner; whilſt the Penitentiaries ſtand round about him, reading the penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Pſalmes, and other devout prayers, as he is expiring: After then that he hath yeelded up his ſpirit unto his Creator, his Chamberlaines prepare hot water with odoriferous herbs, and having waſhed his Body clean therewith, they waſh it all over againe with warme aromaticall white-Wine, fill up all the places thereof, whereat dead perſons doe commonly purge, with Mirrhe and Aloes, ſtuffe his Noſe and Eares with musk, and rub his whole body over with Balſamum. All this performed, the Penitentiaries put on him his ordinary Clothes, and over them ſuch his ſacred veſtments as he was uſed to celebrate Maſſe with, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lay him on a Bier covered with cloth of gold, having the Popes and the Churches armes hanging upon it: under his head they put a pillow of cloth of gold, and at his feet they put two other
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170672:105"/> ſuch like, with two Pontificall Hatts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The Corps is thus adorned in the Popes privie Chamber, where if his Holineſſe dyed in the night, it is kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next day by the penitentiaries, watching and ſinging all the while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: Morning come, the Corps is carried by the Penitentiaries at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time to the great Chappell, the Subdeacon going before it with the Croſſe; as alſo the Gentlemen of the Chappell, ſinging <hi>Subvenite,</hi> together with fifty or three-ſcore burning torches, borne by the deceaſed Popes equires, and all the whole family following after. There the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries ſinging the Veſpers, and Vigils, untill the comming of others of Religious Orders: At length the Colledge of the Clergy, and the convents of Friers repaire thither, and immediately falling to fing the Vigils they ſprinckle the Corps with holy water, cenſe, and abſolve it. That done, the deceaſed Pope is carried with many torches before him, and the whole following after him, to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, and placed in the midſt of it, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines two or three dayes, to the end the people may viſit him, and kiſſe his hand: Then is he returned back to the great
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170672:105"/> Chappell, and in the night interred there: In the meane time preparation is made for his obſequies; an hearſe is erected in the ſaid Church, which is hung all about with the Popes Armes, as well as the ſaid hearſe, and on every ſide of it are formes placed for waxe lights to be ſet upon them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo round about the Church are great waxe lights diſtant from one another the ſpace of a ſpeares length; and on every of the ſaid formes are a dozeon waxe lights more. All things being well diſpoſed then, the Meſſengers of the Roman Court, doe on the evening of the appointed day of the Obſequies give intimation unto all the Cardinalls, Prelates, Ambaſſadors, and Officers of the Court of Rome, that the next day the Obſequies of the late Pope of bleſſed memory doe begin; whereupon the morrow following at a convenient houre, the ſaid Reverend Cardinalls doe all in mourning repaire unto the ſaid Church, and ſett themſelves downe neere to the high Altar on ſeates prepared for them: the like doe the Prelates, Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, and other Courtiers: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Popes domeſtick ſervants doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe early that day march from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170672:106"/> Palace by two and two all in black, to the ſaid Church, where they are placed round about the Hearſe. Then is the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the deceaſed Popes Obſequies begun after the funerall manner of the Church of Rome: and on that firſt day are two hundred Maſſes ſaid, and large almes diſtributed to men and women of ſeverall Orders of Religion for the ſoule of the ſaid Pope; as alſo a ſermon made in the praiſe of him. On the ninth day like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (for ſo long doe the Obſequies laſt) are as many Maſſes ſaid as on the firſt, and every day about an hundred. The ſame ninth day, after the Maſſe of the dead, is alſo the Maſſe of the Holy Ghoſt ſung, and an exhortatory ſermon made for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the new Pope.</p>
                     <p>Upon the death of the Pope the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals doe ſignifie the ſame by their letters to Princes, and great Prelates, uſing the Apoſtolicall ſtile, calling the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſonnes, and the latter brethren, in the manner as the Pope doth.</p>
                     <p>This Vicechancellor alſo aſſooneas the Pope is, dead, takes away the Bulls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Apoſtolicall Letters are ſealed, from the Keepers of them; and that part
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170672:106"/> whereon the name of the Pope is inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, he cauſeth publiquely, and before many perſons to be razed, and made alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit for ſealing: the other part, whereon the heads of the Apoſtles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, he delivers tyed up in a linnen cloth, and ſealed with his ſeale, to the Chamberlaine; taking ſpeciall care that no Letters may be ſealed after the death of the Pope.</p>

At last the new City roſe up again, with Palaces, Churches, Gardens, Pyramides, Columns, and other fabricks, no leſſe to be regarded then the antient: There wants not in it an infinite number of Marbles, and other stones of great price; exquiſite Moſaique works, excellent Pictures, and rare statues, and ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſtreet, which in regard of the multitudes of lodgings in it, is moſt known to ſtrangers, called <hi>della tenta;</hi> as alſo thoſe others <hi>dell' Orſa,</hi> and <hi>di Tor nona,</hi> ſeem to me to be moſt neceſſary for the beginning and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every daies walk, which the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtranger ſhall make to view the moſt curious things of Rome.</p>
                  <p>In going from home, then direct your way to <hi>Elius</hi> his bridge, built by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Elius Adrianus,</hi> at this day called <hi>Ponte Sant' Angelo,</hi> and <hi>di Caſtello:</hi> at the entrance into it are two ſtatues of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> very worthy of regard; the firſt being the handy work of <hi>Lorenzeto Fiorentino,</hi> and the ſecond, the better of the two, of <hi>Paolo Romano.</hi> Adjoining to the ſaid ſecond <hi>Statua</hi> is a Court, appointed for the execution of juſtice, although for great and heinous offences it is done in the hithermoſt Piazza of the Bridge.</p>

                  <p>On the left hand in the <hi>Tiber</hi> you ſhall ſee the relicks of the antient triumphall Bridg between two Mills, whereof there are many on that River, which they ſay was the invention of <hi>Belliſſarius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the forefront of the bridge you ſhall diſcerne <hi>il Caſtel Sant Angelo,</hi> whoſe tower of Maſſie building was made in imitation of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> which ſtood juſt over againſt it on the other bank.

In the year 985. it was named the Caſtle and Tower of <hi>Creſcentius,</hi> from one <hi>Creſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> a <hi>Nomentan,</hi> for that he had fortified it with new works; and though many have done the like, yet was it moſt notably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth: and laſtly it was exceedingly bettered with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170672:113"/> new Bulwarks, Ramparts, and Ditches; and abundantly furniſhed with great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and all ſorts of arms and amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the late Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the eight.</p>
                  <p>Having paſt the Caſtle, you ſhall ſee on your right hand certain Arches united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which were built by the ſaid Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> from the Pontificall Palace to the Caſtle, for the commoditie of the Popes: and the ſaid <hi>Vrban</hi> the eight cauſed them to be covered with a roofe, reſtored them in many places, and ſeparated them from the houſes for the more ſecuritie.</p>
                  <p>On the left hand betwixt the Hoſpitall <hi>di St. Spirito,</hi> and <hi>Borgo Vechio</hi> was the Gate <hi>Aurelia</hi> of the antient City, and according to ſome named the triumphall Gate.</p>
